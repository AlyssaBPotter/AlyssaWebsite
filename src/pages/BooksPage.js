              Ryder Alexander transfers over to UCSD his senior year which is highly unusual. He was
              offered the position as a starting quarterback because it’s number two in state and
              reluctantly accepted. The Aztecs lost their quarterback a couple years prior and have
              been using their backup but the team hasn’t been doing well. So Ryder is brought in to
              try and make a difference. What he doesn’t expect is to meet a blonde beauty who
              completely sweeps him off of his feet.
              <br />
              <br />
              Can Blake move on from her tragic past and open up her heart again to someone who
              might just be worthy of it? Or will the demons from her past come back to haunt them
              both.
